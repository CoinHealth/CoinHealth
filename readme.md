<b>CoinHealth</b> has acquired codes to develop a more efficient and collaborative healthcare community by harnessing the power of blockchain technology and decentralized applications. All codes on beta platform consists of Patient Profile, Team Builder, Appointment setter and Provider Feedback and Directory will be re-written in C++ and converted into a one-stop shop CoinHealth EHR platform.

<b>Project Development Phases</b>

By creating and implementing the blockchain-based platform for patients; providers will have access - to the most powerful tool to improve service quality and solidify a loyal patient base – the patient’s feedback and ratings. During the initial phase of conversion, CoinHealth will focus on developing a blockchain structured EHR with one of its main feature which is the use of public key cryptography to create an append-only, immutable, timestamped chain of medical history. Copies of the blockchain are distributed on each authorized provider in the patient's network.

CoinHealth’s blockchain implementation addresses the four major issues in healthcare: fragmented, slow access to medical data; system interoperability; patient agency; improved data quality and quantity for medical research.

- Blockchain data structures would work well for gathering data from wearable sensors and mobile applications would contribute significant information on the risks versus benefits of treatments as well as patient reported outcomes
- Data from mobile applications and wearable sensors with data from traditional EMR’s and genomics will offer medical researchers increased capabilities to classify individuals into groups that respond well to a specific treatment or who are more susceptible to a particular disease.
- Organize these references to explicitly create and accessible bread crumb trail for medical history without storing raw medical data on the blockchain.
- CoinHealth supplements these pointers with on-chain permissions and data integrity logic, empowering individuals with record authenticity, auditability and data sharing.
- To build a robust, modular APIs to integrate with existing provider databases for interoperability.
- A novel token-mining scheme is proposed to sustain the CoinHealth network and encourage user adaptability on the features of the site.
