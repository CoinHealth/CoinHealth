    More than 1 million purchased health care on the first 2 weeks of open enrollment for 2017 despite repeated proclamations of President-elect Donald Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the marketplace experienced a higher number of enrollees compared to last year's on the same period.
    <br><br>
    More than 1 million consumers purchased health care insurance, of which over 761,785 are renewals, and over 246,433 purchase new coverage. According to officials, 53,000 more enrolled this year compared to last year, based on the total tally for the first 12 days of enrollment.
    <br><br>
    "The American people are demonstrating how much they continue to want and need the coverage the marketplace offers," said Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
    <br><br>
    To avoid a potential tax penalty, most Americans must have a type of health insurance coverage, either through an individual coverage, Medicare, Medicaid or through their employment. For individual health care plans, enrollment is between November 1 through January 31.
