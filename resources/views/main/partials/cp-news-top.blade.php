            The Emerging Value-based Healthcare
        </p>
    </a>
    <p class="content">
        You will be glad to know that there is such a thing as value-based healthcare. In this system of reimbursing healthcare providers, the focus is on the patient's overall well-being and the quality of care received rather than the cost of each procedure or service received from the healthcare providers. Instead of reimbursing costs to healthcare providers based on the number of procedures or services done and the cost of each procedure, they are reimbursed based on the quality and efficiency of care the patient received. Healthcare costs are not paid based on a fee-for-service system, which can quickly pile up the bills, but on the overall quality of care the patient received. It prevents unnecessary procedures and inefficient clinical process that may not even aid in the improvement of your health. Doctors and hospitals are paid not based on the number of procedures and services rendered; they are paid based on their success in keeping you, the patient, healthy, and on promoting your overall well-being.

        You as a patient, will receive better quality care, through the most cost-effective way because healthcare providers will need to ensure that you receive the best care, at the most affordable price, in order for them to get paid.

        Few weeks ago, leaders in the healthcare industry asked President-elect Donald Trump to prioritize value-based care models, which have been promoted under the Affordable Care Act.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        The Health Care Transformation Task Force wrote Trump a letter asking the “new administration and Congress to affirm their support for the transition to value-based care that reduces cost, improves quality and more sharply focuses on patient needs.”
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        While the Affordable Care Act helped advance the shift to value-based care and its payment system, other laws and other regulations also helped further the shift away from fee-for-service. The Task Force hopes that the Trump administration would support the push towards value-based care and inevitably, to more affordable, accessible and high-quality care for Americans.
