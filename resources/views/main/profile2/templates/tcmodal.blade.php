                        Careparrot provides users with access to electronic schedules of the available appointments of doctors, hospitals and other third-party healthcare providers ("Third-Party Providers"). Additionally, the Applications provide users with the ability to exchange certain registration information with Third-Party Providers. Careparrot provides marketing services on behalf of Third-Party Providers to patients or prospective patients (including users of the website) such as email campaigns, search engine optimization (SEO) and electronic directory services. Careparrot also provides Third-Party Providers with the opportunity to create their own Premier Listings, Profile Pages or mini-websites. Careparrot may charge Third-Party Providers a fee for the services and opportunities described in this section. Although Careparrot reserves the right (but does not have the obligation) to monitor, it does not control the content contained within Premier Listings, Profile Pages or mini-websites (including the availability of open appointments), and assumes no responsibility or liability of any kind for any inaccuracies (including inaccuracies regarding available appointments, insurance accepted or network participation) contained therein, or for any qualifications, reference materials or other content available therein.

                        Careparrot allows you to submit and store the name of your insurance or benefit plan, but, except as provided below, Careparrot is not responsible in providing updated information regarding coverage available, healthcare costs, or doctors and hospitals participating in your plan. You should contact your insurance carrier or plan administrator ("Payors") for this information. Payors are third parties, although certain third-party Payors may be affiliated with Careparrot. In some cases, a Payor may contract with Careparrot to provide such Payor's members with information regarding coverage available, healthcare costs, doctors and hospitals participating in the plan, and other content and services ("Healthplan Services"). If your Payor has contracted with Careparrot to make Healthplan Services available to you, you may be able to log in using your insurance or benefit plan member identification number, and access content and services related to your insurance or benefit plan. Although Careparrot reserves the right (but does not have the obligation) to monitor the Healthplan Services (including but not limited to the content and services made available therein, such as network information, coverage and claim information and cost information), Careparrot does not control the Healthplan Services, and assumes no responsibility or liability of any kind for any inaccuracies (including inaccuracies regarding network participation, plan benefits, coverage, features or claim status) contained therein, or for any messaging, reference materials or other content or services made available therein.

                        Careparrot is not responsible for, and shall have no liability in connection with, any transactions or disputes between you and Third-Party Providers or Payors. If you have a dispute with a Third-Party Provider or Payor, you agree to release us (and our employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed (including actual, consequential and punitive damages), arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the Applications or such disputes. You waive any provisions of any state, province, or country law that limit or prohibit a general release, including, if applicable, Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."
